# my-portofolio

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

> **Note** The unit tests depend on packages installed by the above command. Run it before `npm run test:unit` or other scripts.

## Testing Branch Availability

A dedicated branch named `user-run` is available so you can experiment with the refreshed toolchain in isolation. After fetching the repository, check it out locally with:

```sh
git checkout user-run
```

From there you can install dependencies and run the usual scripts shown above. Push the branch to your remote once you have confirmed everything works in your environment.
